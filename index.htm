    <h2>Who is Alice Guo?</h2>
    <p>Alice Leal Guo (Chinese: 郭華萍) is a businesswoman and former mayor of Bamban, Tarlac, Philippines, who served from June 30, 2022, to August 13, 2024. Her tenure was marred by accusations of being a Chinese spy and involvement in illegal gambling, particularly through links to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Offshore_Gaming_Operator#:~:text=There%20were%20security%20issues%20reportedly,weak%20response%20from%20government%20agencies.">Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator POGO </a> activities. In June 2024, she was suspended by the Ombudsman after graft charges were filed by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). Guo was eventually dismissed in August 2024, with her citizenship also being investigated due to inconsistencies in her documentation.</p>
    <p>In July 2024, authorities froze Alice Guo's assets and issued an arrest warrant for her. By August, reports emerged that Guo had fled the Philippines on July 17, initially traveling to Malaysia, then Singapore, and ultimately Indonesia. She was arrested in Indonesia on September 3, 2024, and deported back to the Philippines on September 5. Currently, Guo is being held in police custody in the Philippines.</p>
